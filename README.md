## 🔍 Features

- 🎤 **Voice-Controlled Interface** using Google Speech Recognition & pyttsx3  
- 🧑‍🦰 **Face Tracking** with Haar Cascade  
- 📦 **Object Detection** using SSD MobileNet (COCO model)  
- 📸 **Live Camera Streaming**  
- 🛑 **Real-time stopping & switching** between modules  
- 🧠 **Threaded execution** to keep UI responsive

## 🎯 Example Use Case

```
Voice: "Object tracking"
>> Live camera opens with bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

Voice: "Stop"
>> Tracking stops gracefully.

Voice: "Face tracking"
>> Camera starts detecting and highlighting faces.
```
